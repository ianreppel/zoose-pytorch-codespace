# GitHub Codespace for Zoose

Run Zoose Quantum with many useful Python and quantum computing libraries pre-installed in VSCode directly from your browser with only 2 clicks!

You can either try [Zoose Quantum](https://github.com/ianhellstrom/zoose#zoose-quantum) in VSCode in your browser with only two clicks _or_ run it or any Zoose [flavour](https://github.com/ianhellstrom/zoose#flavours) (e.g. PyTorch) from your own GitHub account and repository (recommended).

## Try Zoose Quantum
Click on _Use this template_ and choose _Open in codespace_

You will be running [Zoose Quantum](https://databaseline.tech/zoose-2.0/#zoose-quantum) in a GitHub Codespace, straight from this repository.
This is best if you want to give Zoose Quantum a whirl but do not intend to save your work in your own account.
Many popular quantum packages (e.g. Braket, Cirq, Pennylane, pytket, Qiskit) are already installed and ready to be used from VSCode, no installation required.

## Run Zoose Base, Neo4j, PyTorch, or Quantum

1. Click on _Use this template_ (green button) and choose _Create a new repository_ (in your own account).
1. Give the repository a name and click _Create repository from template_.
1. Click on _Code_ (green button), choose _Codespaces_, and click _Create codespace on master_ (green button) or hit the "+" sign (near the top).

If you prefer to run a different Zoose flavour, just change the `image` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to the desired flavour, e.g. `databaseline/zoose-pytorch:3.1.1` and commit it to your own repository.

Enjoy your GitHub Codespace.
